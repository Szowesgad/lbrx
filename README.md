# LBRX-MLX / MergeKit-RS

> Ultra-fast LLM model manipulation toolkit for Apple Silicon written in Rust

LBRX-MLX is a high-performance Rust toolkit specifically designed for Apple Silicon, providing 50x more efficient conversion, quantization, and merging of language models compared to traditional Python tools. It leverages direct access to the Metal API and advanced memory management to maximize the potential of M1/M2/M3 chips.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡️ Ultra-fast model format conversion (5-10x faster than Python)
- 🧠 Advanced quantization with minimal quality loss
- 🔄 Model merging with optimal memory utilization
- 🏎️ Dedicated optimization for Metal API
- 📦 Single binary executable (no dependencies)
